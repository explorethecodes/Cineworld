## Code Design & Structure
The code is designed by following the SOLID principles and MVVM design pattern to maintain a clean code architecture. Code separation is maintained using modular approach by creating multiple modules and packages for corresponding features or purpose.

To avoid deep coupling between codes, dependency injection is used, which is Dagger 2 Hilt. Data bindings and view bindings are implemented as well to ease the connection between views and data.

Retrofit is used for fetching the API Network data response. The data flow from the network to the UI is structured through repository and view models before it reaches the UI. The UI component (Activity/Fragment) will be observing the live data in the view model and update the UI accordingly by following the MVVM Architecture.

In short the code structure have,
```
